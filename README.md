# AI-Powered Food Image Classification and Sentiment Analysis

This project leverages advanced deep learning models to classify food images and analyze sentiment from text. We use ResNet-50 for the image classification task to accurately identify various food items from images. For sentiment analysis, we utilize DistilBERT to determine the sentiment expressed in text data efficiently. This combination of state-of-the-art models ensures high performance in both visual and textual data processing tasks.

## Description

### Food Image Classification
Using the ResNet-50 model, the project classifies images of various food items. ResNet-50, a robust convolutional neural network, is renowned for its ability to handle deep layers while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. This ensures that our model can effectively learn and distinguish between a wide range of food categories, providing high accuracy in image classification tasks.

validation accuracy : 86%

### Sentiment Analysis
For sentiment analysis, we employ DistilBERT, a distilled version of the BERT model that retains its high performance while being faster and lighter. DistilBERT is used to analyze text data, determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in user reviews, comments, or any other text sources. This allows businesses to gauge customer satisfaction and feedback efficiently.

validation accuracy : 70%
